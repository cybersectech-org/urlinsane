# Under Development

Generates domain typos and variations used to detect and perform typo squatting, URL hijacking, phishing, and corporate espionage.
Inpired by URLCrazy I wanted to create a better version that supported multiple languages and linguistic typos.
I also wanted it to be a binary with fast execution time.




Generate and test domain typos and variations to detect and perform typo squatting, URL hijacking, phishing, and corporate espionage.

## Introduction
Generate and test domain typos and variations to detect and perform typo squatting, URL hijacking, phishing, and corporate espionage.

## Features
Generates 18 types of domain variants
Knows over 8000 common misspellings
Supports cosmic ray induced bit flipping
Multiple keyboard layouts (qwerty, azerty, qwertz, dvorak)
Checks if a domain variant is valid
Test if domain variants are in use
Estimate popularity of a domain variant URLCrazy requires Linux and the Ruby interpreter.

A wide range of efficient domain fuzzing algorithms
Unicode domain names (IDN)
Multithreaded job distribution
Queries DNS for A, AAAA, NS and MX records
Evaluates web page similarity with fuzzy hashes to find live phishing sites
Tests if MX host (mail server) can be used to intercept misdirected e-mails
Additional domain variants using dictionary files
GeoIP location information
Grabs HTTP and SMTP service banners
WHOIS lookups for creation and modification date
Output in CSV and JSON format

Perform GeoIp location lookup
Get webpage and compare fuzzy hashes
Query WHOIS for records
Query DNS for records
